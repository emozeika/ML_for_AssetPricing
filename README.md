# Machine Learning Applications in Empirical Asset Pricing

This repo was part of the Stevens Institute of Technology Master of Financial Engineering curriculum and was selected as one of Spring-2020 top projects. An executive summary of the project was published on Stevens' Financial System Center website, https://fsc.stevens.edu/machine-learning-applications-in-empirical-asset-pricing-project-sponsored-by-bank-of-america-quantitative-wealth-and-investment-management-qwim/

This project investigates the use of machine learning in the field of asset pricing and assesses its improvements and shortcomings over traditional approaches. To analyze the models a backtesting framework was deployed which allowed for two separate types of analysis: (1) a traditional forecasting analysis which analyzes an asset's return forecast against several statistical benchmark methods and (2) a financial portfolio summary which assesses the portfolio's ability to create superior returns compared to traditional portfolio benchmarks.









Note: This project was sponsored by Bank of America, Merrill Lynch Quantitative Wealth and Investment Management department. This repo is a copy of the private repo and excludes some propreitary resources.
